Docker Containerization and Deployment Project

This repository demonstrates the practical application of containerization using Docker. It includes creating Docker images, running applications within containers, and managing multi-container setups using Docker Compose.

Project Overview

1. Dockerfile Creation and Image Build

	•	Objective: Create a Dockerfile to define the environment for an application and build a Docker container image for the application developed in the Jenkins module.
	•	Outcome: Successfully created a Dockerfile and built a Docker container image, encapsulating the application and its dependencies into a portable container.

2. Running the Application in a Container

	•	Objective: Create and run a Docker container from the application image, using port mapping to access the application via a web browser.
	•	Outcome: The application was successfully containerized and run in a Docker container. Port mapping was configured to allow access to the application through a web browser, demonstrating container portability and accessibility.

3. Docker Compose with Application and MySQL

	•	Objective: Demonstrate the use of Docker Compose to manage and orchestrate multiple container services, including the application and a MySQL database.
	•	Outcome: Docker Compose was used to define and manage the application container alongside a MySQL container. This setup was successfully started and stopped, showcasing the ability to handle multi-container environments using Docker Compose.

Conclusion

This project illustrates essential skills in Docker containerization, from creating images to managing complex multi-container setups with Docker Compose. It demonstrates proficiency in deploying and managing containerized applications, which are key components in modern DevOps practices.
